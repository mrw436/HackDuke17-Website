## Inspiration

How can the level of education of a parent impact the education of their child? Picture this scenario: if a student doesn’t understand a homework problem, they can ask their parents for help explaining the concept. It’s probably a familiar situation for many of us, but parents in underprivileged families may not be able to help with their children’s education. A study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that kindergartners without a parent that had completed high school scored consistently lower on reading, science, and math than students without any educational risk factors. 

We are working to combat this educational inequality for the benefit of students and parents with LearnTogether, a website that provides both resources and a community for parents without secondary or higher education. It allows parents to follow along with their child’s education and to learn alongside their kids.
