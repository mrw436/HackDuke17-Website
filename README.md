## Inspiration

Inspired by the challenges children with poorly-educated parents face in learning and keeping up with their peers, we created LearnTogether to create a community of parents that can learn together and connect.

Some Stats:
National Center for Family Literacy: 47% of parents struggle to help their children with their homework because they don't understand the subject matter (http://www.familieslearning.org/)

## What it does

-LearnTogether connect parents to a structured learning environment that encourages discussion and community

-Parents are able to better understand from other parents how learning topics like Math is important even though they might not have learned it

## How we built it

We built it using JavaScript and HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. We used the Facebook API to allow users to login to our site and to create the comments sections for each video. We used git to collaborate together and 3/4 of us made our first pull requests!

## Challenges we ran into

 We also ran into challenges using the Facebook API without hosting it online but we eventually figured out that we needed to put localhost in the app domain.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're super proud of the final product and that we made a way for parents to connect. We're proud of figuring out how to use the Facebook API for logging in and questions and how to create JavaScript methods to move users from page to page based on users were logged in to Facebook or not.

## What we learned

3/4 of us made our first GitHub pull request! Also, 3/4 of us wrote our first webapp so we did learned a lot of HTML and JavaScript!

## What's next

We would love to expand to more school districts and work with teachers to come up with more helpful activities for parents to learn and engage with eachother and their students.
