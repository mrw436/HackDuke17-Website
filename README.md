## Inspiration


Inspired by the challenges children with poorly-educated parents face in learning and keeping up with their peers, we created LearnTogether to create a community of parents that can learn together and connect.

How can the level of education of a parent impact the education of their child? Picture this scenario: if a student doesn’t understand a homework problem, they can ask their parents for help explaining the concept. It’s probably a familiar situation for many of us, but parents in underprivileged families may not be able to help with their children’s education. A study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that kindergartners without a parent that had completed high school scored consistently lower on reading, science, and math than students without any educational risk factors. 

We are working to combat this educational inequality for the benefit of students and parents with LearnTogether, a website that provides both resources and a community for parents without secondary or higher education. It allows parents to follow along with their child’s education and to learn alongside their kids.


Some Stats:

## What it does

LearnTogether connect parents to a structured learning environment that encourages discussion and community. Parents can log in with Facebook, input their state and child's grade, and access resources and educational standards for whatever topic their student is learning. Users are able to interact with and learn from other parents, building their knowledge together and improving the education of everyne involved.

## How we built it

We built it using JavaScript and HTML/CSS/Bootstrap. We used the Facebook API to allow users to login to our site and to create the comments sections for each video. We used git to collaborate together and 3/4 of us made our first pull requests!

## Challenges we ran into

We ran into challenges using the Facebook API without hosting it online, but we eventually figured out that we needed to put localhost in the app domain.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're super proud of the final product and that we made a way for parents to connect. We're proud of figuring out how to use the Facebook API for logging in and questions and how to create JavaScript methods to move users from page to page based on users were logged in to Facebook or not.

## What we learned

3/4 of us made our first GitHub pull request! Also, 3/4 of us wrote our first webapp so we did learned a lot of HTML and JavaScript!

## What's next

We would love to expand to more school districts and work with teachers to come up with more helpful activities for parents to learn and engage with both their students and each other.
